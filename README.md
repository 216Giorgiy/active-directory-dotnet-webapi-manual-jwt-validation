WebAPI-ManuallyValidateJwt-DotNet
=================================

This sample demonstrates how to manually process a JWT access token using the JSON Web Token Handler For the Microsoft .Net Framework 4.5.  This sample is equivalent to the NativeClient-DotNet sample, except instead of using OWIN middleware to process the token, the token is processed in application code.
